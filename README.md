# Python-Projects
Here is bit of a dump of past python projects!

This is just a package containing a few of my favorite projects I've worked on using python. This is all non-gui so far.
Many of the programs have been commented thoroughly describing the project itself, what each function/object does, and how each function/object operates.
This is a habit I've gotten into to increase readability, understanding, and making it easy to work with in the future.

Some of these projects are standalone games, some a demonstration of concepts, and some are assignments done for University courses.
Each uses specific skills and concepts to operate, and are representations of what I am capable of!

1) War: Same as the card game, whomever has the highest card wins. If they match, they call war and lay down a set amount of cards and the highest
        card on the last one wins. It contains 3 files:
        a) shuffleCards.py: This is a specialized program that produces a fully randomized deck of cards in a text file, following a specific format.
        b) shuffledDeck.txt: This contains an entire randomized deck of cards, following the regular 52 card format.
        c) War.py: The main game controller
        
2) 2048: This is one of the programs I am most proud of as it was challenging, a great learning experience, and it was a satisfying completion.
         It is the exact same as the popular phone game, minus the gui.
         
3) BoundedVsCircular: Just a quick time comparison between Bounded and Circular Queues! 

4) CustomerService: Circular Queue algorithm containing two queues of VIP and non VIP status.

5) GuessingGames: Classic game of guessing between 1 and 100, but with a small twist where it can be the computer guessing what number you're thinking.

6) Q2: This is one of the more complicated applications I've created, and one that I am very proud of. 
       This is a almost full application for a ride share service with a text based interface. It contains:
          a) A login screen
          b) A main menu
          c) A fully functioning mail system between users
          d) A search function for rides, taking to and from locations, date, and amount of passengers into consideration.
          e) A functional booking system
          f) A SQL data base using SQLite to store and retrieve data.
          
7) SolutionToNim: My personal favorite application that I've created. So this is Minimax, a solution to the game of nim. 
                  The game of nim is simple strategy game where two players (min and max in this case) must 
                  divide the remaining objects using two different numbers until somebody cannot do more.

                  This program calculates every single possible outcome that could happen
                  using recursive methods. Enjoy it, but I personally suggest not going over 12 unless 
                  you've got a powerful computer due to the exponential nature of the program.
                  
8) TicTacToe: Classic TicTacToe game between two players!
